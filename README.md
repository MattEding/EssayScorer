__Investigation__:  
Can machine learning be used to accurately assign grades to essays?

__Tools__:  
See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MattEding/EssayScorer/blob/master/requirements.txt)

__Implementation__:  
Use [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/) to extract most language features.  
Use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) to make classification models.  

__Application__:  
Give the [scorer app](https://github.com/MattEding/EssayScorer/blob/master/src/scorer/app.py)
